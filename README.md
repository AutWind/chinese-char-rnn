http://arxiv.org/abs/1410.4615

### Requirements
tensorflow 1.0.0

### Model
* Recurrent Highway Network with Multiplicative Intergration

### Hyper-parameters
Using Adagrad as optimezer.
it was used gradient descent algorithm with 1.0 learning rate before,
but cannot decrease the loss significanly
